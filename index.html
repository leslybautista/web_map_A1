                <h3>Democracy</h3>
                <p> Democracy is broadly understood to mean ‘rule by the people’. <br>
                    In practice, it is often defined as people choosing their leaders in free and fair elections. <br>
                    Other definitions go beyond this. For example, some of them see democracy as people having additional individual rights and being protected from the state.<br>
                    Democracy gives citizens the right to influence important decisions over their own lives and allows them to hold their leaders accountable.</p>

                <h3>Autocratization</h3>
                <p>
                    Autocratization is the process of moving away from democracy towards autocracy. <br>
                    It can be understood as a gradual erosion of democratic institutions and practices, leading to a more authoritarian regime. <br>
                    This can include restrictions on political freedoms, media censorship, and the undermining of checks and balances within government.</p>

            <h2>The world has recently become less democratic</h2>
            <p>
                Democracy is in decline, whether we look at big changes in the number of democracies and the people living in them; at small changes in the extent of democratic rights; or at medium-sized changes in the number of, and people living in, countries that are autocratizing.2 The extent of this decline is substantial, but it is also uncertain and limited. We can see it clearly across democracy metrics: the world has fallen from all-time democratic highs to a level similar to earlier decades. But the extent of this decline depends on which democracy measure we use. And it is limited in the sense that the world remains much more democratic than it was even half a century ago.
