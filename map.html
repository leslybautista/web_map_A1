                <h2>State of Liberal Democracy, 2024</h2>
                <p>This map illustrates the global distribution of political regimes in 2024, based on data from the V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) dataset. It categorizes countries into four main regime types: <strong>Liberal Democracy</strong>, <strong>Electoral Democracy</strong>, <strong>Electoral Autocracy</strong>, and <strong>Closed Autocracy</strong>.</p>
                <p>Overall, the 2024 global trend shows a continued divergence: while some regions maintain or strengthen democratic norms, others have seen democratic backsliding and the entrenchment of autocratic practices. This visualization aims to provide a snapshot of these political landscapes and encourage reflection on the state of governance worldwide.</p>

            <p>Liberal democracies, which are characterized by strong institutions, rule of law, civil liberties, and checks on executive power, are predominantly found in Western Europe and North America. Countries like Canada, Germany, and Sweden exemplify this category, along with several nations in East Asia and Oceania, such as Japan and Australia.</p>
            <p>Electoral democracies, while still holding regular elections, often lack the full institutional safeguards or civil rights protections of liberal democracies. These regimes are more commonly seen in parts of Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>On the other end of the spectrum, electoral autocracies are countries where elections exist but are not free or fair, and political competition is severely limited. Many nations in South and Central Asia, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa, fall under this classification.</p>
            <p>Closed autocracies represent the most repressive form of government, where no meaningful elections take place and power is concentrated in the hands of a small elite or a single leader. This regime type is prevalent in parts of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
